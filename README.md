# Marketing Attributes
Project on Codecademy to explore marketing attributes 

Queries start by finding the number of distinct visits to the website, then source and campaign from the page visits, and then finally the page names. 

Next, the First Touches from each campaign per user is grouped, counted, and sorted
Then the number of Last Touches from each campaign per user is likewise grouped, counted, and sorted.

The distinct count of Purchases was then counted. 
Next the Last Campaigns were looked at by purchase data to determine which campaigns finally led to the purchase
These were finally counted and then grouped.
